#Item Catalog
#### Project Overview
This is an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
#### User Guide
To get started, download the *client_secrets.json* file provided separately by me (or you can create your own from console.developers.google.com) and put in the main directory.
The main page will be http://localhost:5000
